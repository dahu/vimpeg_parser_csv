VimPEG Parser for CSV
---------------------

_alpha, demo_

This is a demonstration of the VimPEG PEG parser generator library.

It provides the following rudimentary CSV operations:

* `CSV_Parse()` for parsing a range of CSV lines in the current buffer
  and returning the data as an array of arrays.
* `CSV_Print()` for printing an array of arrays as CSV data to the
  current buffer.
* Displaying the current CSV column in the statusbar. A standalone
  function, `CSV_Column()` is also provided for those who find the
  statusbar _feature_ too cumbersome (it is a bit of a process hog).

NOTE: To disable the automatic includion of the column information in
your `statusline`, add the following line to your `~/.vimrc`:

  let g:vimpeg_parser_csv_statusline = 0
